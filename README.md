# OutOps Emotion – Practice Repository

This repository contains a practice set of visual, audio, and video stimuli used to learn how to organise mixed-media research assets using GitHub.

### Folder Structure (click to view)

- [**images/**](images/) – visual stimuli  
- [**audio/**](audio/) – audio files  
- [**video/**](video/) – video assets  

### Purpose

This repo was created as a formative exercise to:
- practise setting up a clean, reproducible folder structure  
- work with different media types (images/audio/video)  
- understand how GitHub Pages hosts and displays assets  
- prepare for managing materials in real experimental projects  

### Note  
These assets are not part of an active study.
